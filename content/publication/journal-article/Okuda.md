**Background**

Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with gastric cancer; thus, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Since _H. pylori_ infection in adolescents or young adults shows few symptoms, screening tests are necessary for this population. In this study, the accuracy of the rapid urine-_H. pylori_ antibody (u-HpAb) test was evaluated and compared to that of urine and serum _H. pylori_ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (u-HpELISA and s-HpELISA, respectively) in junior high school students.


**Methods**

All 1,225 students attending the junior high schools in Sasayama city were invited to participate in this study. Urine and blood samples were assayed for anti-_H. pylori_ immunoglobulin G antibodies, and rapid u-HpAb was performed by three investigators independently. When the judgment of all investigators was in accordance, a positive or negative result was defined. Discrepant judgment was defined as an undetermined result.


**Results**

In total, 187 students participated in this study and provided both urine and blood samples. Three students showed undetermined results with rapid u-HpAb. Excluding these results, the positivity rate of rapid u-HpAb was 3.3% (6/184), whereas that for u-HpELISA and s-HpELISA was 4.8% (10/187) and 5.9% (11/187), respectively. Using s-HpELISA and u-HpELISA as the standards, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of rapid u-HpAb were 85.7%, 100%, 100%, and 99.4%, respectively when excluding the undetermined results of rapid u-HpAb.


**Conclusions**

The rapid urine-HpAb test had excellent specificity but relatively low sensitivity.
