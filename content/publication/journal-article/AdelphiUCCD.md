## Abstract

**Introduction**: Bowel urgency (BU) is among the most disruptive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) symptoms. However, data on its prevalence and association with disease activity are limited. This real-world study of Japanese patients with IBD evaluated BU prevalence and compared clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) between patients with and without BU.

**Methods**: Data were drawn from the Adelphi IBD Disease Specific Programme™, a cross-sectional survey of physicians and their patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Physicians reported demographic and clinical data, including disease activity measures (Mayo score and CD Activity Index [CDAI]), for consulting patients, who voluntarily completed a patient-reported questionnaire, including HRQoL measures (Short IBD Questionnaire [SIBDQ] and EQ-5D-5L). Outcomes were compared between patients with and without BU using t-, Fisher exact and Mann-Whitney U tests as appropriate.

**Results**:  Of 120 UC patients, 27.5% (n = 33) self-reported BU; physicians were unaware of BU in 54.5% (n = 18) of these patients. Patients with BU had higher mean Mayo scores (p < 0.01) and lower mean SIBDQ scores (47.9 vs 56.6, p < 0.01) than patients without BU, with mean EQ-5D-5L scores 0.83 and 0.87, respectively (p = 0.06). Physicians were satisfied with treatment but believed better control could be achieved for 39.4% of patients with BU and 35.6% without. Of 114 CD patients, 17.5% (n = 20) self-reported BU; physicians were unaware of BU in 75.0% (n = 15) of these patients. Patients with BU had higher mean CDAI scores (p < 0.01) and lower mean SIBDQ (48.7 vs 56.2, p < 0.01) and EQ-5D-5L scores (0.81 vs 0.88, p < 0.01) than patients without BU. Physicians were satisfied but believed better control could be achieved for 40.0% of patients with BU vs 19.1% without.

**Conclusion**: Patients with BU have worse clinical outcomes and HRQoL than patients without, underlining the need for improved physician-patient communication regarding BU and new IBD therapeutic options.
