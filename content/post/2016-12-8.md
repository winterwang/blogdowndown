We start today with the unlikely story of how an American woman came to be working with truckers to combat human trafficking. Kendis Paris lives in Denver, Colorado with her Anglican priest husband and <span class="diff_off">her</span> <span class="diff_add">their</span> two children. She used to spend her days making bread and cheese, home with <span class="diff_off">her</span> <span class="diff_add">the</span> kids. But now she travels the country<span class="diff_alert">,</span> training drivers to <span class="diff_off">recognize</span> <span class="diff_add">recognise</span> and report human trafficking. Her <span class="diff_off">organization</span> <span class="diff_add">organisation</span> is called Truckers Against Trafficking, or TAT. She told me what inspired her to set it up. </p><p class="linetext">It was around 2007 and I read a book by David Batstone called Not For Sale. And before that <span class="diff_alert">,</span> I probably could give you a working definition of human trafficking<span class="diff_off">if</span> <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_add">but</span> that's about it. And I picked that up at the direction of my mother <span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="And ">and </span>got to <span class="diff_alert" title="chapter ">Chapter </span><span class="diff_off">3</span> <span class="diff_add">Three</span> and <span class="diff_off">I</span> was so appalled and outraged I <span class="diff_off">have</span> <span class="diff_add">had</span> to flip to the back of the book to find out how to help. </p><p class="linetext">What did that book say <span class="diff_alert">,</span> that shocked you so much? </p><p class="linetext">It was the level of systematic <span class="diff_off">reap</span> <span class="diff_add">rape</span> for profit <span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="That ">that </span>just floored me. I just <span class="diff_off">could</span> <span class="diff_add">couldn't</span> believe the numbers<span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert">.</span> I couldn't believe that <span class="diff_alert" title="modern day" >modern-day</span>  slavery existed on this scale<span class="diff_alert">,</span> around the world and right here in the United States.

* _Words_ worth to be remembered:
    * human trafficking: ` 贩卖人口。 例句： It has deciphered secret communications about murder, drug transactions, illegal gambling and human trafficking. 那些密码涉及到了谋杀、毒品交易、非法赌博和贩卖人口之间的秘密联系`
    * Anglican[ˈæŋglɪkən]: ` adj. 英国国教会的。 例句： It is now an Anglican church.  它现在是英国圣公会。`
    * appalled[əˈpɔ:ld]: ` adj. 惊骇的；丧胆的。 例句: He looks appalled, as if I've tried to assault him.  他那样子显得很惊骇，仿佛我试图袭击他。`
    * priest: `n. 牧师，神父，教士`
    * **British English** lists an alternate spelling as recognise, **but the main entry is recognize**. **North Americans (yes, that includes Canada) prefer the _ize_ spelling**, and **this is accepted everywhere.** However, **outside North America some prefer the ise spelling and it is not incorrect.** This spelling change goes across all derivatives including: recognizability, recognisability, recognizable, recognisable, recognizeably, recognisably, recognizer, and recogniser.
    * **Organise and organize are different spellings of the same word**. Organize is the preferred spelling in the U.S. and Canada, and **organise is more common outside North America**. This extends to all the word’s derivatives, including organized/organised, organizing/organising, and organization/organisation.
    * rape for profit: `为了盈利的抢夺/强奸`
    * give a working definition: `理论上/操作型/工作上的定义`
    * direction: `n. 方向；指导；趋势；用法说明`
    * floor: `n. 地板，地面；基底；议员席；楼层 v. 铺地板；打倒；难倒`
    * modern-day: `adj. 现代的`

## 譯文

今天这个故事听起来似乎不大可能：一位美国女人与卡车司机们联手合作，共同打击贩卖人口。肯蒂斯•帕里斯和她的丈夫——一名英国国教牧师——以及两个孩子生活在科罗拉多州丹佛市。她过去经常在家制作面包和奶酪，陪孩子们在一起。但是现如今，她走遍全国各地，教授司机去识别并上报贩卖人口的犯罪行为。她有一个名为“卡车司机打击贩卖人口”的组织，简称TAT。她告诉我是什么启发她建立这个组织的。

大概2007年的时候，我读了大卫•巴斯顿的《非卖品》。在此之前也许我能够给出贩卖人口的定义，但仅此而已。我在母亲的推荐下阅读了这本书。在读到第三章时，书中的内容令我既惊恐又愤怒。我不得不将书翻到最后去寻找帮助他们的办法。

那本书里讲了什么让你如此震惊呢？

里面涉及被拐卖后强迫卖淫的问题，真的让我吃惊极了。我无法相信那些数字。我无法相信在现代社会还有如此规模的奴隶制度依然存在，而且遍及世界各地，甚至就在美国。
