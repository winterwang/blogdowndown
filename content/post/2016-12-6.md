## 譯文

最近几个月，一些人像得老年痴呆一样忘事的行为见诸报端。二月初，埃德·鲍尔斯忘记他的商业伙伴比尔·托马斯的名字。几个星期后，绿党领袖娜塔莉·贝内特在接受伦敦广播公司尼克·法拉利采访时差点没回忆起绿党政策。嗯，我敢打赌，埃德·米利班德也希望我们早点忘记去年秋天他在工党会议上忘了提及国家经济的囧事。其实我完全能够理解这些政治家，因为我和他们一样，都一把年纪了，总是记不得东西，该死的。

心不在焉的习惯我早就有了。我30多岁时经常是晚上把车停好白天就忘了停哪。我经常忘记前一天做过的事情，而且还会记不起别人的名字。

不过我一直擅长多线程工作，我丰富的知识还曾经让我当上大学挑战队的队长。曾经的我也可以在政治辩论里意气风发，崭露头角。

现在不行了。因为我糟糕的记忆力，儿时成为国会议员的梦想已离我远去，我记不住面孔，统计数字甚至政策，我记不清名字，好像患了失语症一般，我的认知能力也下降了很多，太可怕了。
