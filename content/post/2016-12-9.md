## 譯文

演讲写作也是一种职业，我想并不是所有人都知道还有这样的职业存在。那么，萨拉达，你能给我们讲讲演讲撰稿人是做什么的吗？

当然可以。而且我也很想听听对蒂娜和科索沃来说会有什么不一样的地方。对于我们来说，演讲撰稿人的职责就是真正地帮助演讲者发现自己的心声，弄清楚自己想要表达什么、怎样去表达。我个人觉得，演讲的真正作用就是说服听众去相信某件事、去做某件事。所以在我看来，作为一名演讲撰稿人，你的工作并不是替演讲者出主意，而是帮助他们发现并且弄清楚自己的想法、确立论据，然后找到最有说服力的方法来传达这条论据。

跟我的想法不谋而合。对我来说，了解亚希亚加总统所关心的问题、了解她的看法是很重要的。如果你想让演讲有影响力、令人难忘、又符合总统本身的特点、还要反应她和她的内阁成员们所关心的问题，那么在演讲里穿插她的个人经历以及她的政治立场也是很重要的。

这点很有意思，“符合总统本身的特点”或者其他你为之写作的人物的特点。那么为了写出好的演讲稿，你是不是得充分了解他们才行？

对我来说，能在总统的身边听她谈话、听她跟各种各样的人交谈——跟她身份相当的人交谈，或是跟科索沃的普通民众——对我是很有帮助的。当我在写演讲稿的时候，我会觉得几乎得完全摒弃自己的声音，要用她的语气、她的用词，这样演讲才会最贴近她本身的说话方式。所以，对的，演讲稿是要跟演讲者的谈吐、跟他们本身的化学效应相匹配的。
