This is somewhat unique to Italy. It's not a striking difference<span class="diff_alert">,</span> but it's a noticeable one.

    * I'm not sure what to make of it:

## 譯文
这种展开方式我不太熟悉。但你觉得它们之间都是有某种联系的？

嗯，首先，相比于世界上许多其他地方来说，意大利的地震更趋向于多震源或连续发生。意大利在这点上多少有点特别。这个特点不是多么突出，却也是很明显的。这很可能是因为意大利的地质断层形成时间还不够长，还不到一百万年。把它跟圣安地列斯的断层一比，人家已经一千多万年了。所以这些都只是断层碎片，还没有受到地震的频繁推挤而变成那种大范围的连续光滑断层。那么这就意味着，如果动了一个断层，那它周围其他的断层也会跟着移动。而断层中的任何一个都不可能造成大范围地震，震感也不可能很强。所以才会有这些小的中级震群或震族。

但是你提到了几年前拉奎拉的那次地震很有意思，先是有一些震动——我不确定之后发生了什么——然后在八月份又发生了一次，这中间隔了很长一段时间，结果几周之后又发生了一次，然后又发生了一次。这几次地震之间的时间间隔和距离间隔都让我觉得很奇怪。我不知道该怎么理解这个问题。

嗯，确实有趣。就一次典型的地震来说，就说六级地震吧。它会产生余震。余震有一种独一无二的特性：过去的时间越长，波及的范围就越广。但是震级并不会随着时间而降低。
