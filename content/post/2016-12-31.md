<p class="linetext">The documentary <span class="diff_alert">,</span> Life, Animated illustrates the story not just with clips from the films<span class="diff_alert">,</span> but also its own animation. And it travels from Owen's childhood through adolescence into adulthood<span class="diff_alert">,</span> and even moving from home. Director <span class="diff_alert">,</span> Roger Ross Williams had already begun to film with the family before Ron's book, which is also called Life, Animated, was published. He knew his documentary had to differ from, even go beyond the book<span class="diff_alert">,</span> and give voice to a new character in the family drama - Owen's mother. </p><p class="linetext">Cornelia had never really talked about it<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="So">so</span>, <span class="diff_add">and</span> because <span class="diff_off">Cornel</span> <span class="diff_add">Cornelia</span> is so private<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="So ">so </span>for her, every time she would start, I <span class="diff_off">would've</span> <span class="diff_off">told</span> <span class="diff_off">them</span> <span class="diff_add">went</span> to <span class="diff_off">help</span> <span class="diff_add">tell</span> <span class="diff_add">and</span> <span class="diff_add">then</span> <span class="diff_add">have</span> her <span class="diff_off">held</span> <span class="diff_add">tell</span> the story. She would burst into tears. So it was hard to keep her from crying. Cornelia<span class="diff_alert">,</span> as a mother<span class="diff_alert">,</span> was determined to connect with Owen at any cost. And even when the doctor said, <span class="diff_alert">"</span> do not encourage this obsession with Disney<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="Lock ">lock </span>up the television<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert">"</span> <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="And ">and </span>they did lock up the television for a point in the book.
