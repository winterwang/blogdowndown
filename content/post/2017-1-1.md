* _Words_ worth to be remembered:
    * make headlines: `出现在头条新闻位置；受到宣扬。 例句： But other software, developments, and trends are sure to make headlines and seduce developers in 2010.  但是其他软件、开发和趋势等在2010年必定会成为开发人员所关注的头条新闻。`


## 譯文
1996年，美国女子体操队史上最年轻的运动员多米尼克·莫西阿努荣获了奥运金牌。她的父母来自罗马尼亚，受到罗马尼亚知名体操运动员纳迪亚·科马内奇的启发，他们对女儿也抱着很高的期望。

我父母打从心里希望自己第一个孩子，也就是我，能成为一名体操运动员。1981年他们移民来美国时，这个愿望就扎根在他们心里。在我6个月大的时候，他们以测试我的力量为乐趣。我家没有洗衣机和烘干机，于是他们把我挂在晾衣绳上，想看看我能在上面坚持多久。

我的天呐。

没错。我父亲过去老说这实在是太令人惊叹了：“你居然坚持到晾衣绳都断了”。当然，他们在那里接着我呢。他们觉得这就在向他们暗示我将来肯定能成为一个真正的体操运动员。而我从三岁起就在美国进行体操训练。我同时学习网球和体操。网球运动确实很棒，但是我不像立刻爱上体操那样喜爱网球，而且从那一刻起，其余都是历史了。
