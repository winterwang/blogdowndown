## 譯文

Ben说他曾经想要杀戮。但也有一些人是被逼无奈才这么做的。二战期间，作为参战人员的S.L.A. Marshall观察到当时很多人都没有开枪。他做了一个名叫《反对战火的人》的研究，在这份报告里他得出的结论是人们不愿意杀戮。这些人叫做不开枪的人。Marshall说害怕杀戮而非害怕被杀其实是战斗失败的最常见的原因。Marshall研究的方法虽然一直遭到质疑，但是他得出的大结论还是被广泛接受，那就是士兵一般不愿开枪。Giles Frasers博士在英国国防部学院做了以道德为主题的演讲。

“我认为人类自内心深处就对杀戮有排斥。S.L.A. Marshall发现战斗步兵队伍中，只有15%到20%的人能够朝敌人开枪。而80%的人在面临开枪那一刻实际上是会产生抵触情绪而不愿意这么做的。我认为这个发现很特别。葛底斯堡的战役也很特别。当时有27000把来复枪和步枪散落在战场上，其中90%的枪都上了膛。实际上这是因为没有人开枪。”
