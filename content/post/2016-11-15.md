## 譯文

我们今天要讲的是发生在印度洋上的精彩逃生故事。2009年6月，一架由也门驶向科摩罗群岛的飞机在距目的地几英里处不幸坠入大海。坠机报告显示事故发生的原因之一是人为失误。这起空难造成152名乘客丧生，只有13岁的法国女孩巴希亚·巴卡里幸存下来，媒体都称她为“奇迹少女”。7年过去了，她告诉我事故发生的情况。

当时我和妈妈一起去度假。我们去参加妈妈亲戚这边的一个婚礼。我有点担心，因为我很久没坐过飞机了。出发那天早上，我的叔叔和表兄开车送我们去了机场。

你还记得当时飞机怎么样吗？因为有报告表明它当时状态不是太好。

是的。那天我们乘坐了两架飞机——先是开往也门的萨那，然后再从也门飞往科摩罗。是的，当时飞机的状态不是非常好。飞机里有只苍蝇，还有非常难闻的、像厕所里的味道。但是除此以外，直到事故发生，整个飞行过程都是正常的。

那你还记得飞机降落时的情况吗？

飞机正常飞行了很长的一段时间，大家都睡着了。突然他们通知我们要降落，让所有人都系好安全带。但是大家都在睡觉，人们都非常安静，我很担心。我看着大家，心想：为什么你们都不怎么害怕或者尖叫呢？突然我感觉到飞机穿过大量气流，接着就如同掉进黑洞一般。我不省人事，醒来时发现自己身在水中。
