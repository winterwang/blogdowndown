## 譯文

如果你发现你能从银行不断地取钱，而且所取数目早已超出你存进账户的金额，你会怎么做？2010年3月，澳大利亚的年轻人卢克·穆尔碰巧遇到这样的事。他在圣·乔治银行分行开设了一个账户。一个管理方面的错误导致他不论何时申请贷款，都能被自动批准。接下来两年时间里，他取走了200多万澳元，约合150万美元。他告诉我他是什么时候发现他能无限制地取钱。

事情就那么慢慢发生了。起初我只有一个日常的银行账户，用来支付我的房贷、医保等等这类东西。第一周左右，我正在发愁“没钱还贷款，我该怎么办？”但是居然成功受理了。于是我就想“那好吧”。接着下一个月我又成功得到了一笔400块的贷款，然后又一笔。这一状态一直持续了12个月，而这一切都是在我账户透支的情况下发生的。

那么银行没找过你、而你也没觉得应该找银行问问发生了什么吗？

我不知道自己怎么想的。这事困扰了我一段时间。那会儿我是个年少无知的22岁小伙子，哪懂什么银行系统之类的东西。
