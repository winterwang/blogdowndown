## 譯文
据联合国特使称，叛军控制的阿勒颇市部分地区目前正处于俄罗斯和叙利亚政府军的包围之下，并将在接下来的两个月中变得满目疮痍。战争开始前，阿斯马尔·哈拉比和父亲在市内经营了两家家具店，但是都被炮击摧毁。目前他开了一家孤儿院，收养了50个孩子，他们中很多人的父母都在轰炸中丧生。失去亲人的不光是孩子们，阿斯马尔的父亲和他四姐妹中的三人也都不幸遇难。远在阿勒颇的他向我讲述了2014年学校遭受空袭那天的事，当时他的两个姐妹和他现在的妻子正在那里上学。 那时有一个13岁以上孩子参加的画展，那也是学年结束的日子，所以有一些庆祝活动。当时学校被执政势力袭击，整个校园被毁。我是在早上9点半左右得到的消息。有人打电话告诉我这件事。我立刻赶往学校，找到了其中一个不幸丧生的姐妹。我在废墟和瓦砾中一直寻找我另一个姐妹，找了两三个小时也没找到她的踪迹。后来他们告诉我她在医院，我们在那里找到了她。她已经在袭击中身亡。我们整日地寻找我的妻子，四天过去都没找到，直到后来他们给我们打电话，说她在学校被发现，当时就被送进了医院。
