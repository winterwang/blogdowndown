<p class="linetext">There are many views about the concept of redemption. It's generally defined as the action of saving or being saved from sin, error <span class="diff_alert">,</span> or evil.

## 譯文
“救赎（redemption）”一词的概念有多种解读。它通常指挽救过失、罪恶，或从过失、罪恶中得到解放的过程。我们用这一词表明某人曾犯下罪行。而今天我们的嘉宾未曾犯过罪行。事实上，她在13岁时遭到严重的暴力虐待。玛德琳·布莱克曾被强奸。而她如今认为，自己通过“原谅”得到了救赎。

玛德琳，一个人要怎么寻求或者得到这样的救赎？

“寻求救赎”并非我本来的打算。这是三样东西的结合。我曾以为我已经从过去的伤痛中走了出来，那些创伤已经被治愈了。但总有东西潜藏着，让我无法真正释怀。在我长女快到13岁时，我已经接受了3年的心理治疗。我的治疗师暗示我那些人可能并非生来就是强奸犯。但我一点也不想去原谅他们。我只希望他们也被绑架、被绑起来、被强奸、被折磨数小时，就像他们曾对我做的那样。然而，心理医师的话却像颗种子被植入我的脑海，并开始生长。我开始想要了解他们为什么会走上“强奸”这条路。他们并没有比我大多少，大概17、18岁。我想知道，他们怎么会对别人那么残酷、暴力，他们曾看到、听到或经历过什么事情，导致他们会做出这样的行为。
