<p class="linetext">How is Donald Trump going to avoid damaging <span class="diff_off">conflict</span> <span class="diff_add">conflicts</span> of interest once he takes up his position as America's next president? A planned press conference was scheduled for this week on the matter<span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_add">It's</span> now being <span class="diff_off">canceled</span><span class="diff_add">cancelled</span>. Mr <span class="diff_alert">.</span> Trump would only say via his <span class="diff_off">tweeter</span> <span class="diff_add">Twitter</span> feed that no new <span class="diff_off">deal</span> <span class="diff_off">will</span> <span class="diff_add">deals</span> <span class="diff_add">would</span> be done while <span class="diff_off">he</span> <span class="diff_off">was</span> <span class="diff_add">he's</span> in the White House. That adds to an earlier pledge he made, that he <span class="diff_off">will</span> <span class="diff_add">would</span> step down from the day-to-day management of his far-flung global business empire. Still, many say those measures don't go far enough. So <span class="diff_alert">,</span> what are the precedents for how presidents deal with their business affairs <span class="diff_add">once</span> in office? A question for Norman Eisen, who <span class="diff_off">is</span> <span class="diff_add">was</span> the Chief White House Ethics Lawyer for the Obama administration. </p><p class="linetext"> </p><p class="linetext">Ever since the passage of the Ethics in Government Act in 1978 that American presidents have <span class="diff_off">utilised</span> <span class="diff_add">utilized</span> <span class="diff_add">what</span> we refer to as a qualified blind trust or the equivalent. That means that they take their business <span class="diff_off">interest</span> <span class="diff_add">interests</span><span class="diff_alert">,</span> and they give them to the trustee to dispose of<span class="diff_alert">,</span> convert <span class="diff_off">it</span> into cash<span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="And ">and </span>then reinvest behind <span class="diff_off">the</span> <span class="diff_off">wallet</span> <span class="diff_add">a</span> <span class="diff_add">wall</span> <span class="diff_add">of</span> blindness. So the president doesn't <span class="diff_add">know</span> what his investments are, in order to avoid conflicts. As long as the president has investments known to him and others<span class="diff_off">you</span> <span class="diff_alert">,</span> <span class="diff_add">you'll</span> always have the risk that his <span class="diff_off">judgement</span> <span class="diff_add">judgment</span> will be distorted <span class="diff_alert">.</span> <span class="diff_alert" title="Or ">or </span>others will reach out <span class="diff_off">in</span> <span class="diff_off">an</span> <span class="diff_add">and</span> attempt to use his investments to influence him.


* _Words_ worth to be remembered:
    * pledge:`n. 抵押；典当品；许诺；誓言；信物 v. 保证，发誓；用……抵押`
    * far-flung:`adj. 广布的,广泛的,蔓延的,遥远的`
    * trustee:`n. 受托人；理事；信托公司 v. 移交…给受托人`
    * dispose:`phr. 处理，解决；转让，卖掉；吃光；除掉`
    * **Judgment vs. judgement**: In American English, **judgement is generally considered a misspelling of judgment** for all uses of the word, notwithstanding individual preferences. **In British popular usage, judgment was traditionally the preferred form**, but judgement has gained ground over the last couple of centuries and is now nearly as common as judgment.
    * blind trust: `保密信托 例： Yang transferred the shares into a blind trust earlier this week. 这个星期的早些时候杨把股票转成了保密信托。`


## 譯文

当唐纳德·特朗普真正宣誓就职美国下任总统时，他如何避免利益冲突带来的损害？本周原定关于该主题的一次记者招待会被取消了。特朗普本人只在他的推特上发文称其在白宫期间不会达成新的交易事项。这也呼应了其前不久的誓言，即他将退出对其遍布全球的商业帝国的实时管控。但仍有很多人认为这一举措不可能持久。那么以前那些成为总统的人是如何处理他们的经济事项的呢？我们请来了奥巴马政府的白宫首席道德律师，诺尔曼·艾森。 自从1978年美国政府道德法案得以通过，美国总统可以充分利用我们所说的合乎标准的保密信托或类似手段。这意味着他们将剥离这些商业利益，并置于信托人处理，转换为现金，再背对背地进行二次投资。所以美国总统们不会知道他们投资于何处，就是为了避免冲突。只要总统们或其他人知悉这些投资，总统的判断就很有可能被左右，或者其他人将利用这些投资游说总统意图影响他。
