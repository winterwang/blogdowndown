## 譯文
（水面）安静的可怕。我知道洪水可能在任一时刻到来，卷着巨浪猛烈地拍向我们。我的两个小孩子紧紧的抓着我。他们看到他们的父亲沉入水中，消失不见。我们没看到他再次浮出水面。之后我们也被水淹没。我拼命地想让孩子们活下去。他们紧紧抓着我，我奋力去抓住高处。水上大量的泡沫使我们难以呼吸。到处都是碎片残骸。我曾听闻洪水的可怕，我知道更糟的情况将来临。

我的孩子们上下扑腾着拼命去呼吸。四下都看不到他们父亲的身影。大部分人已经丧命。空气中弥漫着难闻的气味。周围飘浮着尸体的残肢、失去生命的孩童的尸体。我知道很快，很快第二波洪水就要来临。我想尖叫，但我不能。我的孩子们还不知道他们面临的是什么。

如果现在不离开，等待我们的只有死亡。我必须想办法。我必须为我们找到逃命的出路。水面降下去很多。我们可以移动了。为数不多的幸存者已经准备逃离了。他们四下惊逃。我们都在找出路，不停的找。我的孩子们紧跟着我，不想被落在后面。然后我看到了它，我看到了出路，它向我们敞开。

“孩子们，我们要走了。我们必须离开我们的家，找一个新的住所。洪水又要来了。跟着我，尽你们所能的紧跟着我。”

其他人在靠近。这是我们的机会，唯一的逃生的机会。
